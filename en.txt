My mom is baking cookies this afternoon. We could go to my house and eat some.
How does that sound? My grandmother died when I was 14, and for years,
she stood still in my memory as a patient woman with salt-and-pepper hair.
Born in China to missionary parents, Jean spent her 20s and early 30s travelling throughout Canada
and the United States as a nurse. She raised four kids in the small Canadian city of Whatever
and cared for me, my brother and our cousins every summer in nearby Niagara Falls.
She obliged us to write summer diaries, habitually loaded us in her minivan and drove us to a nearby pond to catch frogs.
When I got tired of playing with the boys, we’d sit down in a quiet spot,
I’d lean against her and she’d read me a book.
So-called 'tiny homes' first emerged as a remedy to the affordable housing crisis,
 but they can actually pose surprising problems.
All the tiny-houser millennials that I interviewed wanted to own bigger houses in future;
they saw tiny living as a means of owning something now and being able to save at the same time.
Several young couples planned to upgrade once they had children,
 selling their tiny homes or even keeping them as guesthouses.
